# Fast-Agent Homepage Documentation

## Overview
**fast-agent** is a comprehensive framework for creating and interacting with sophisticated Agents and Workflows in minutes. It's multi-modal - supporting Images and PDFs in Prompts, Resources and MCP Tool Call results.

## Key Features

### 1. Set up in 5 minutes
- Install [fast-agent-mcp](https://pypi.org/project/fast-agent-mcp/) with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) and get up and running in minutes
- Quick installation and setup process

### 2. Batteries Included
- Out-of-the box examples of sophisticated Agents, Workflows and advanced MCP Usage
- Prebuilt agents and examples implementing the patterns in Anthropic's [building effective agents](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-effective-agents) paper
- Get building valuable applications quickly

### 3. New - Elicitation Quickstart Guide
- Get started with MCP Elicitations for User Interaction
- [Try now](https://fast-agent.ai/mcp/elicitations/)

### 4. Comprehensive Test Suite
- Comprehensive test automation, accelerating delivery and assuring quality

### 5. MCP Feature Support
- First MCP Host to support Tools, Prompts, Resources, Sampling and Roots
- [Reference](https://fast-agent.ai/mcp/)

### 6. Agent Developer Friendly
- Lightweight deployment
- In-built Echo and Playback LLMs allow robust agent application testing

## Getting Started

### Installation and Basic Commands
```bash
# Install fast-agent
uv pip install fast-agent-mcp

# Start an interactive session
fast-agent go

# Start with a remote MCP
fast-agent go --url https://hf.co/mcp

# Create Agent and Configuration files
fast-agent setup

# Run your first Agent
uv run agent.py

# Create Agent workflow examples
fast-agent quickstart workflow
```

### Core Capabilities
- **Multi-modal Support**: Images and PDFs in Prompts, Resources and MCP Tool Call results
- **MCP Integration**: Seamlessly use MCP Servers with your agents, or host your agents as MCP Servers
- **Pattern Implementation**: Prebuilt agents and examples implementing Anthropic's building effective agents patterns

## Documentation Structure

The fast-agent documentation is organized into several main sections:

### Agents
- **Defining Agents and Workflows**: How to create and configure agents
- **Deploy and Run**: Deployment options and execution methods
- **Prompting Agents**: How to interact with agents
- **Instructions**: Setting up agent instructions and prompts

### Models
- **Model Features**: Understanding model capabilities
- **LLM Providers**: Supported language model providers
- **Internal Models**: Built-in models for testing and development

### MCP (Model Context Protocol)
- **Configuring Servers**: Setting up MCP servers
- **Integration with MCP Types**: Working with MCP type system
- **Quickstart - Elicitations**: User interaction features
- **Quickstart - State Transfer**: Transferring state between agents
- **Resources**: Additional MCP development resources

### Reference
- **fast-agent go**: Command-line interface reference
- **Config File**: Configuration file format and options
- **Command Line**: Command-line options and switches
- **Class Reference**: Programmatic API reference
- **Open Telemetry**: Observability and monitoring
- **Azure Configuration**: Azure OpenAI setup and configuration

## Quick Start Workflow

1. **Install**: `uv pip install fast-agent-mcp`
2. **Setup**: `fast-agent setup` (creates configuration files)
3. **Create Agent**: Write your first agent with `@fast.agent()` decorator
4. **Run**: `uv run agent.py` to start your agent
5. **Deploy**: Use `--server` flag to deploy as MCP server

## Key Benefits

- **Rapid Development**: Get sophisticated agents running in minutes
- **Multi-modal**: Support for text, images, and PDFs
- **MCP Native**: Built for the Model Context Protocol ecosystem
- **Production Ready**: Comprehensive testing and deployment options
- **Developer Friendly**: Built-in testing models and debugging tools

## Community and Resources

- **PulseMCP**: Featured on PulseMCP - find thousands of MCP Servers for your Agents
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation at fast-agent.ai
- **Examples**: Built-in examples and quickstart guides
- **MCP Ecosystem**: Integration with the broader MCP community
